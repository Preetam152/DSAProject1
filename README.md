# Sorting Algorithms Performance

This project benchmarks the performance of various sorting algorithms â€” Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Modified Quick Sort â€” on different input sizes and array orderings (random, sorted, reversed).  
It prints execution times and generates a performance plot saved as `sorting_algorithms_performance.png`.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

You need Python(version 3.8 or above) installed.  
This script uses two external libraries:
- matplotlib
- pandas  

Install them with:
pip install matplotlib 
pip install pandas 

## Get the desired ouptut by runing the script: "python sortingalgorithms.py"
It will:
1) Print execution times per algorithm and input size to the console
2) Save the performance plot as sorting_algorithms_performance.png in the current directory
